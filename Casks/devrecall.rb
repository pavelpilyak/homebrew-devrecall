  caveats <<~EOS
    The `devrecall` CLI is bundled inside DevRecall.app and symlinked into
    Homebrew's bin. If you previously installed the standalone CLI formula,
    remove it so its symlink doesn't shadow the bundled one:

      brew uninstall pavelpilyak/devrecall/devrecall-cli

    A single `brew upgrade devrecall` now upgrades both the GUI and CLI.
